# Fillit - 42 - Project 02

#### Introduction

Fillit is a project allowing you to discover and/or familiarize yourself with
a recurring problem in programming: the search for an optimal solution
among a very large number of possibilities, within a reasonable period of time. In the case of this
project, it will be a question of arranging the Tetriminos between them and determining the smallest square
possible to accommodate them.

A Tetriminos is a geometrical figure formed of 4 blocks that you know
thanks to the famous Tetris game.

#### Objectives

Fillit does not consist in recoding Tetris, but remains a variant of the game in mind.
Your program will take in parameter a file describing a list of Tetriminos
which he will then have to fit together to form the smallest possible square. The aim is to
of course to find this smallest square as quickly as possible in spite of a number
of layouts that grows explosively with each additional room.
