# Fillit - 42 

#### Introduction

fillit is a project of 42 aiming to familiarize us with the research for the best solution to a problem (here a puzzle) in an optimal time. In the case of this project, it will be a question of arranging the Tetriminos between them and determining the smallest square
possible to accommodate them.

A Tetriminos is a geometrical figure formed of 4 blocks.

this implementation is not the most optimal, indeed the one using bitfields is faster.

#### Objectives

The aim is that the program find this smallest square as quickly as possible in spite of a number
of layouts that grows exponentially with each additional room.

#### Permitted functions

◦ exit
◦ open
◦ closed
◦ write
◦ read
◦ malloc
◦ free
